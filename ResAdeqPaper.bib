The related data requirements may be subject to difficulties due to the temporal variability and spatial distribution of wind power in connection with the limited databases currently available. This paper presents a methodology to identify the minimal amount of data required for reliable studies. Based on wind power data of 74 stations in Ireland, covering up to ten years, the effects of different numbers of stations and different time periods of data on the capacity value are analyzed. The calculations are performed by means of a fast calculation code. The results show that at least four to five years of data in an hourly resolution are necessary for reliable studies and that 40 to 50 evenly distributed stations give an acceptable representation of the total wind power generation in Ireland.},

abstract = {Power systems are planned such that they have adequate generation capacity to meet the load, according to a defined reliability target. The increase in the penetration of wind generation in recent years has led to a number of challenges for the planning and operation of power systems. A key metric for generation system adequacy is the capacity value of generation. The capacity value of a generator is the contribution that a given generator makes to generation system adequacy. The variable and stochastic nature of wind sets it apart from conventional energy sources. As a result, the modeling of wind generation in the same manner as conventional generation for capacity value calculations is inappropriate. In this paper a preferred method for calculation of the capacity value of wind is described and a discussion of the pertinent issues surrounding it is given. Approximate methods for the calculation are also described with their limitations highlighted. The outcome of recent wind capacity value analyses in Europe and North America, along with some new analysis, are highlighted with a discussion of relevant issues also given.},

abstract = {The penetration of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is increasing in many countries, with significant implications for the adequacy and operation of power systems. This work considers the Nord bidding zone within Italy, which hosts 7.7 GW of PV and almost no wind power. We simulate the implications of different PV penetration levels on the need for firm generation capacity and on ramping requirements over one to several hours. We compare ten years of synthetic hourly PV generation series derived from CM-SAF SARAH satellite data and observed load. The analysis also provides insights into the storage capacity required to smooth residual load over different time horizons. Results show that without storage (i) the penetration of PV in the region does not sensibly reduce the need for firm generation; (ii) the marginal contribution of PV to meet power demand decreases with its penetration; and (iii) high penetrations lead to larger and more frequent ramps, although extreme ramp rates do not last more than 1 h. The availability of storage significantly alters these results, but large storage capacities are required. Smoothing net load by a few hours requires 2–7 GWh of storage per GW of PV installed.},

abstract = {An important issue for electricity system operators is the estimation of renewables' capacity contributions to reliably meeting system demand, or their capacity value. While the capacity value of thermal generation can be estimated easily, assessment of wind and solar requires a more nuanced approach due to the resource variability. Reliability-based methods, particularly assessment of the Effective Load-Carrying Capacity, are considered to be the most robust and widely-accepted techniques for addressing this resource variability. This report compares estimates of solar PV capacity value by the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) capacity expansion model against two sources. The first comparison is against values published by utilities or other entities for known electrical systems at existing solar penetration levels. The second comparison is against a time-series ELCC simulation tool for high renewable penetration scenarios in the Western Interconnection. Results from the ReEDS model are found to compare well with both comparisons, despite being resolved at a super-hourly temporal resolution. Two results are relevant for other capacity-based models that use a super-hourly resolution to model solar capacity value. First, solar capacity value should not be parameterized as a static value, but must decay with increasing penetration. This is because—for an afternoon-peaking system—as solar penetration increases, the system's peak net load shifts to later in the day-- when solar output is lower. Second, long-term planning models should determine system adequacy requirements in each time period in order to approximate LOLP calculations. Within the ReEDS model we resolve these issues by using a capacity value estimate that varies by time-slice. Within each time period the net load and shadow price on ReEDS's planning reserve constraint signals the relative importance of additional firm capacity.},

abstract = {Demand response (DR) and electrical energy storage (EES) are key attributes within the context of smarter and more sustainable power systems. However, little work has so far systematically investigated the reliability implications of deploying DR and EES at the system level, including the impacts of characteristics such as the energy payback and flexibility of DR or the capacity and efficiency of EES. Nevertheless, this is fundamental to address the questions as to how DR and EES affect system reliability and whether and to what extent they could displace generation capacity while maintaining sufficient system adequacy. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a general framework to evaluate the contribution of DR and EES to adequacy of supply by specifically modelling and analysing their operational flexibility parameters and constraints. Specific studies are run using sequential Monte Carlo simulation that allows capturing the relevant inter-temporal constraints. The results suggest that, given a prevailing generation portfolio, DR and EES could reduce the frequency and cumulative duration of interruptions, although these might become more severe. The amount of generation that could be displaced is then quantified, which is found to be less than the peak reduction provided by DR and EES while preserving system adequacy. The models and findings of this work are thus critical to quantitatively inform the energy policy debates about the potential of DR and EES to provide system capacity and participate in relevant markets.},

This paper estimates the capacity value of a load-shifting resource which is capable of providing multiple services. The capacity value represents the contribution of a resource to generation adequacy and an understanding of this contribution is important to compare how different power system resources can assist power system operators and planners. Additionally, policy-makers and market operators need an appreciation of the capacity value of different resources in order to design capacity remuneration mechanisms. A building energy model coupled with a power system model, co-optimizing the supply-side and the demand-side, is employed in this paper to estimate the capacity value of a specific load-shifting resource. The resource examined is electric thermal storage heating devices for space and water heating. Ireland is used as a test case. It was found that these load-shifting devices can provide an adequacy contribution to the power system and thus have a capacity value. The capacity value, for the Irish case, can be up to 26{\%} for the DR resource in question for the given year but the values are typically much lower due to operational constraints (reserve provision) and due to occupancy profile impacts. The results highlight the need for holistic modeling of demand response resources, as well as the need for additional work for different load-shifting resources and more data.},

abstract = {In this report, we examine the potential for replacing conventional peaking capacity in California with energy storage, including analysis of the changing technical potential with increased storage deployment and the effect of PV deployment. We examine nine years of historic load data, a range of storage durations (2-8 hours), and a range of PV penetration levels (0{\%}-30{\%}). We demonstrate how PV increases the ability of storage to reduce peak net demand. In the scenarios analyzed, the expected penetration of PV in California in 2020 could more than double the potential for 4-hour energy storage to provide capacity services.},

Energy storage can reshape the peak demand period. Each storage increment may have to provide more energy than the previous.

This report considers the idea of replacing peaking capacity with energy storage in California.

9 years of load data, 2-8 hrs of stroage, PV 0 - 30{\%} penetration

As PV penetration increases, the potential of 4hr storage increases. What?? page V, also page 1

Capacity credit -- ability to provide all of peak demand? page 5. Explained at top of page 6. Higher is good?

Fig 2? Why is blue line different than black line?

Page 14, Fig 10: is PV counted as negative demand? Just rooftop PV counted as negative demand?

Some confusing points in the conclusion.

Some good future research points. It is interesting how capacity value changes with amount of renewables on the system.},

abstract = {This article describes some of the recent research into the capacity value of wind power. With the worldwide increase in wind power during the past several years, there is increasing interest and significance regarding its capacity value because this has a direct influence on the amount of other (nonwind) capacity that is needed. We build on previous reviews from IEEE and IEA Wind Task 25a and examine recent work that evaluates the impact of multiple-year data sets and the impact of interconnected systems on resource adequacy. We also provide examples that explore the use of alternative reliability metrics for wind capacity value calculations. We show how multiple-year data sets significantly increase the robustness of results compared to single-year assessments. Assumptions regarding the transmission interconnections play a significant role. To date, results regarding which reliability metric to use for probabilistic capacity valuation show little sensitivity to the metric.

abstract = {The concept of capacity value is widely used to quantify the contribution of additional generation (most notably renewables) within generation adequacy assessments. This paper surveys the existing probability theory of assessment of the capacity value of additional generation, and discusses the available statistical estimation methods for risk measures which depend on the joint distribution of demand and available additional capacity (with particular reference to wind). Preliminary results are presented on assessment of sampling uncertainty in hindcast LOLE and capacity value calculations, using bootstrap resampling. These results indicate strongly that, if the hindcast calculation is dominated by extremes of demand minus wind, there is very large sampling uncertainty in the results due to very limited historic experience of high demands coincident with poor wind resource. For meaningful calculations, some form of statistical smoothing will therefore be required in distribution estimation.},
annote = {Abstract: Survey of existing probability theory of capacity value from including additional generation. Focuses on wind. Results show that large sampling uncertainty exists when high demand exists in periods of low wind as not much history exists for this case.

Prob theory for ELCC and EFC

Conclusion: Preliminary results have been presented on assessing sampling uncertainty in hindcast LOLE and capacity value calculations while using bootstrap resampling. Not realistic enough to quantitatively assess risk study for the Great Britain system. Nonetheless, results prove that there is a large sampling uncertainty when the "demand minus wind" dominates the adequacy risk.
